              Once you play a card:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Deterministic Capture:</strong> If there is exactly one matching option
                  (for example, a single card on the table that has the same value as your played card),
                  that option is applied automatically.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Non-deterministic Capture:</strong> If several capture combinations are
                  available, you will be prompted to choose one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>No Capture:</strong> If no capture option is available, your played card
                  is simply added to the table.
                </li>

              If a capture occurs, you collect both the card you played and the cards captured from
              the table. The collected cards become part of your team treasure (which is the aggregate
              of both teammatesâ€™ captured cards).
            </li>
            <li>
              If the table becomes empty after a capture (except in the last turn), this is counted
              as a scopa, awarding you an extra point.
            </li>
            <li>The turn then passes to the next player.</li>

            <li>
              <strong>Deterministic Capture</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rule: If you play a card that exactly matches a single card on the table,
                  you must capture that card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Example: You play a 7 and there is a single 7 on the table. You capture that 7
                  automatically (even if there are also a 4 and a 3 that sums to 7).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-Deterministic Capture</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rule: If there is no single matching card, you may capture a combination of cards
                  whose values sum to the played card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Example: You play a 7. On the table, there is no single 7, but there are two
                  possible options:
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Option A: A 3 and a 4 (3 + 4 = 7).</li>
                  <li>Option B: Two 2â€™s and a 3 (2 + 2 + 3 = 7).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>In this case, you will be prompted to choose one of the available combinations.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Special Scenario: Multiple Identical Cards</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rule: If there are multiple identical cards on the table that match your played
                  card, you may choose which one to capture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Example: You play a 7 and there are two 7â€™s on the table. You can choose which 7
                  to capture.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Capture Option</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rule: If no combination of cards on the table matches your played cardâ€™s value,
                  your card is added to the table.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Example: You play a 4 but the table has no cards or combinations that sum up to 4.
                  The played card remains on the table.
                </li>

              The game starts with 4 cards on the table and 9 cards per player. Players take turns
              playing cards. Depending on the cards on the table, a capture may occur automatically
              or you may need to choose between several options. Points are awarded based on the
              number of cards collected, the number of Denari, capturing the 7 of Denari, achieving
              the best Primiera, and the number of scopa.
